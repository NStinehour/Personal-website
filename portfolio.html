      <p> This is my porfolio page! Here, you will find pictures and descriptions of some projects that I completed in the past, from programming to art!</p>
    <h3>LEGO programming camp</h3>
    <p>During the 2021 summer LEGO programming camp hosted by my local community college, I created various robots such as a color sensor, a converyor belt, and a CNC (robot that can draw/create designs) using Lego pieces and motors. After we completed building the robots, we then programmed it to make it perform certain actions. Below is a picture of the CNC machine that I built and programmed.</p>

    <h3>Artworks</h3>
    <p>Below are some artworks that I am quite proud of!</p>
    <p>This is a sketch I did of a traditional Chinese style building. I lived in China for 8 years before moving to Canada (after living there for 3 years I came here to Killeen, Texas), so I have always admired certain parts of the Chinese culture.</p>

    <p>These are some clay sculptures that I made last year for my art class. They are from the movie 'My Neighbor Totoro',which is a classic Japanese anime movie. I loved the movie as a kid (and still do now),so I decided to make some clay Totoros in memory of the movie. To make the sculpture, I used air-dry clay to form the shapes, waited for the clay to completely dry, and then painted the colors using acrylic paint.</p>

    <p>This one isn't exacty an artwork but it holds special meaning to me. I joined the American Red Cross back in 2020 and I participated in the Young Ambassador Program. Before Christmas in 2020, we made thank-you cards to active soldiers living in our area. Out of dozens that I made, this one is my favorite!</p>
