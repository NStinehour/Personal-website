      This is my About Me page! On the page, I listed some of my hobbies, favorite things, and favorite animal :)
      </p>
    

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>When I was in Canada, I attended to a lot of classes offered by a sport center near my apartment. There, I took numerous swimming lessons and at one point I passed all 10 levels! I do like to swim as a way to relax, even though I haven't done it in a long time because there isn't a proper swimming pool near my house. </p>

    <p>In addition to swimming lessons, I also took badminton courses! I love playing badminton because it's fun, engaging, and an opportunity to compete with the person on the other side of the net.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Food</h3>
    <p>It's hard to pick a favorite, but ice cream is definitely near the top of the list. My favorite ice cream brand is Blue Bells, particularly because they always stuff the ice cream cans to the very top and make delicious flavors. My favorite flavors are coffee, vanilla and strawberry cheesecake!</p>

    <h3>Favorite Animal</h3>
    <p>My favorite animals are golden-retrievers! They look cute and fuzzy, both as puppies and adults. I'm hoping to adopt a dog from animal shelter someday, and I really hope I can find a golden!</p>
