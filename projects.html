    <h3> <a href="https://personality-quiz.ninastinehour.repl.co/">Personality Quiz</a></h3>

    <img src="assets/question.png" alt="two people engaging in a conversation; one person is saying question marks while the other shows multiple lightbulbs">

    <p>In this short 3-question personality quiz, it tests whether you are a stem or an arts & humanity person basing off your answers. Validity of result is not 100% guaranteed.</p>

    <h3> <a href="https://activist-toolkit-starter-code.ninastinehour.repl.co/index.html">Save the Strays</a></h3>
    <img src = "assets/Adopt.jpg" alt="a hand reaching down to pet a black labrador-looking dog.">
    <p>This is another project (in addition to the Personality Quiz)that I did as a part of Girls Who Code program. In this website, I created a fact generator that provides different facts about pet abandonation and adoption with each click. I also listed some of the ways people can help in the cause and Save the Strays. I chose this topic because I have a passion for helping animals and I hope this website can educate and even motivate some people to choose to adopt over buy.</p>
